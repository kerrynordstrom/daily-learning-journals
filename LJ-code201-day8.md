Today I started to learn how to back off the code, look at it high level, and start to refactor the code so that I can have smaller blocks that execute in predictable ways.  I am still working to apply this as of Day 9 (turning this in late), but given the material and high level thinking discussed in this morning's lecture, I have an even better handle on how JS operates.  With the notion of hoisting, I definitely see how defining variables and methods differs from the order of operations in assigning values and executing of the code.  I look forward to tidying up my salmon cookies project with this knowledge!
