Today I learned another lesson in planning and looking to your cohort for perspective.  I talked through Rob's code for about an hour at the end of the day, and seeing his prep work and comprehension of the task at hand opened my eyes more to exhaustive brainstorming, big picture lists, and breaking down of those high level ideas to small psuedocode concepts.  It's too late to start planning for this lesson as I feel like I have an OK start, but I will continue to take my time with pseudocode and high level lists in the future.
