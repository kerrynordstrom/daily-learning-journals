Today I learned a hard lesson in not only planning layout of a page in a timely manner, but delegation of duties amongst teams based on perceived strengths and to avoid duplication of work.  In addition to this, it may be important to ask for clarification on the directions handed down by the project manager as following them to a T might not be best practice in all occasions.  My partner and I started the lab strong by reading the assignment overview very and executing as closely as possible.  By spending time duplicating work (a DRY red flag), we created immediate merge conflicts and avoided delegation of work.  We then attempted a pair programming tactic, which slowed us down further.  A better understanding of Git and the merge process, in addition to separating the workflow (one works on HTML, the other on CSS), we would've gotten way closer to completing the assignment.  Anyhoo, a nice lesson to learn early for later course corrections!
