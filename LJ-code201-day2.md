Today we worked in some familiar JavaScript territory with singular var assignments, prompts, alerts, console.logs, and if/else statements.  The pre-work helped tremendously (specifically Team Treehouse lessons).  JavaScript, despite being "loose" in its application of particular details makes a lot of sense.  My confidence got rocked later in the day, however, when attempting CSS, which I have never been confident in.  I feel like it'll require a lot more best practice study to choose the appropriate use cases for the numerous key/value pairs I tried.  We will see once we hit more structured CSS instruction, which I am excited to start en route to CSS mastery.
