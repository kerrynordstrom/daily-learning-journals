Today was our first attempt at pair programming.  I worked with Ariel and it went great.  Aside from an initial hiccup where we cloned the repo prior to forking, we were able to communicate our goals effectively and in addition to completing the main task of adding function to the logic of our question structure, we simultaneously cleaned up our syntax and logic.  Today I learned more about CSS than I have in the past 15 years of dabbling in this frustrating feature of web dev.  Who knows if I've gotten over the hump of understanding the impact of position and float, but I am certainly excited to try!
