Today I reinforced the importance of planning, this time in the form of writing a priority list the night before.  We accomplished a lot on Wednesday, but still had plenty of ground to cover to have a strong MVP for presentation.  We scrapped some of our loftier goals entirely and wrote out our High, Medium, and Low priority goals for this project.  Because we set out a reasonable set of *high* priority goals, we accomplished these long before the end of the day.  Our *medium* priority goals are still achievable in future releases of this web app, but the strong base laid by the highest priority ones is what will carry us to better bug fixes and general UX improvement.
