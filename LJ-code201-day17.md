Today I learned that it's never too early to step away from the codes and return to your wireframe/domain model/whiteboard.  The high level approach to coding cannot be overstated.  We got stuck in doing intricate things with localStorage and not thinking about the actual problems we wanted to solve prior to any engagement with persistence.  Once we pulled away, drew it on the board, and thought about how some logic interacted with other parts of the project, it was much plainer what needed to be done.  We'll go into today with a similar high level review of the tasks needed from here on out.
