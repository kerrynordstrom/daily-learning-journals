Today I learned another lesson in reading and following the problem domain, which often lays out a "shotgun approach" to the problem.  This is good enough for our classwork and to learn the quick and dirty way to solve a problem.  In spending a couple hours to refine this approach, I learned a further lesson in that providing very specific information to solve a problem is much more difficult.
