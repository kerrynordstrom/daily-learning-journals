Today I learned that being passionate about your product is essential to having a cohesive team and presenting your best work.  From the very start, our team cared about our product and where it will go in the near future because of our connections with the subject material, the military.  Because our product so clearly defined a problem domain and and presented an interface that will dramatically cut the time needed to achieve the task, it should be an easy sell to the end user.  We will continue to work on the final product and should have something to present to thousands of end users by the end of our 301 course, and perhaps our 401 as well.
