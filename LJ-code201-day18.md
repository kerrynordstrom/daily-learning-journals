Today I learned plenty of things, though one elegant solution for a problem we couldn't quite figure out came from Amanda.  She pointed us towards invoking an event listener via dot notation, in this case "onblur".  This simple substitution for our normal event listener dispelled the confusion we had for an hour.  This opens the door for any number of other event listeners which can be utilized this same way.  This also makes me wonder about other seemingly static methods I've called in the past that might be able to to be used in this similar way via dot notation.
