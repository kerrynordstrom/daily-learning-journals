Today I began to realize how important it is to pay attention to global and local variable reach.  Previous to this lesson, I didn't note that within an object, embedded functions cannot reach higher level key/value pairs without proper dot notation using "this" as a modifier.  Once this clicked, it became a lot easier to construct the object and methods that use these key/value pairs.  It is still a lot of work to set up multiple objects, so I'm excited for constructor functions and prototypes!
